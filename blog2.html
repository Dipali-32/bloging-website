        <h1 class="font1"> My Story of Building a Profitable Cybersecurity Blog: How Much Do I Earn?
            Giedrius Saulenas
            ILLUMINATION</h1>
        <p class="font1">
            With the rise in cyberattacks, the demand for cybersecurity specialists is increasing. As this role requires significant knowledge and proficiency in various tools, there’s also a growing need for high-quality cybersecurity content. </p>
        <p class="font1">
            One way to address this need for high quality technical content is through informative blogs. Recognizing this, I decided to start my own cybersecurity blog.

So, in this article, I will share my experience of building a cybersecurity blog and how much money I earned from it. </p>
        <p class="font1">
            I was starting my career as a penetration tester and learning new things all the time. I found many topics in cybersecurity that I could write about. I knew there was a demand for this content.

            There are still many topics to write about in the field of cybersecurity. It’s not saturated, and if you create high-quality content, you’ll definitely find your place.
            
            I also wanted my blog to earn money.
               I started the blog 2.5 years ago. Today, it remains a popular website, even though I stopped writing for it a year ago. Here are the visitor numbers from this year:

        <p class="font1">
            Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms which enable computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. Here are some fundamental machine learning techniques:

            <li>
I would also encourage you to do the same — no matter what niche you are in — be it cybersecurity or not, writing a blog will be beneficial for you in many ways.

Topics I Decided to Cover in My Blog

These were the initial categories I decided to focus my blog on:

Bug Bounty Tips: This includes everything related to bug bounties, such as security issues found, bug bounty platform reviews, vulnerability program reviews, etc.


The premium GeneratePress theme costed me 59$ usd for a year.</li>
            <li>My Journey: For example, the process of learning something new or discovering a bug.
                Course and Book Reviews: Since I am constantly learning, I often review educational materials.
            </li>
            <li>Tool Tutorials: Tools are crucial for a security researcher. That’s why I dedicated a separate category to them.
            </li>
            <li>Defensive Security Tips: This is a category for everything that doesn’t fit into the previous ones. I publish articles about general security topics under this category.
                Initial Costs</li>
            <li>
                Of course, from time to time, I will review and update my articles as needed. However, I am not planning to create new content at the moment.
                
                I hope my story was useful.</li> </ul> </div>
